                        My name is Muhaimen Ahmed.  I am a New Yorker born and raised in Queens.  I am 26 years old and a Baruch College gruaduate.  My hobbies include weight lifting, photography, and videogaming. <br>  Ever since I was a child, the internet has been a significant part of my life.  Whether it was figuring out how to hook my PC up to dial up in 1999, adding more RAM to my PC to run Half Life 2 in 2004, or figuring out how to use the developer console in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in 2006; I was always able to find the right resources solve the problem in front of me.  In the present, I want to pursue a carreer in web development.  This is my portfolio; I hope you enjoy learning about me here.
